# FastAPI JSON response classes

FastAPI supports custom responses, among them there is support for multiple JSON response implementations. Default is  [JSONResponse](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#jsonresponse) but [orjson](https://github.com/ijl/orjson) and [ujson](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson) are available as well.
Both have their [benchmark](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson#benchmarks) / [performance test](https://github.com/ijl/orjson#performance)claiminig they are the fastest, but worths checking for the given usecase.
