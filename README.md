# FastAPI performance optimisation

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a great, high performance web framework but far from perfect.
This document is intended to provide some tips and ideas to get the most out of it 

## Middleware

FastAPI is based on [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) which supports [Middleware](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/middleware/?h=middlew#middleware), a codebase which wraps your application and runs before / after the request processing.
With this you can resolve various functions ( authentication, session, logging, metric collection, etc) without taking care of these functions in your application.
Unfortunately the most straightforward implementation has a drawback, it has major impact on the application latency and throughput. 


### Baseline measurement

| **Test attribute** | **Test run 1** | **Test run 2** | **Test run 3** | **Average** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Requests per second | 1022.9 | 1026.24 | 923 | **990,71** |
| Time per request [ms] | 97.762 | 97.443 | 108.260 | **97,6025** |


### With one middleware

| **Test attribute** | **Test run 1** | **Test run 2** | **Test run 3** | **Average** | Difference to baseline [%] |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Requests per second | 686,21 | 689,44 | 674,9 | **683,52** | -44,94 |
| Time per request [ms] | 145,728 | 145,044 | 148,17 | **146,31** | 33,29 |

### With two middlewares

| **Test attribute** | **Test run 1** | **Test run 2** | **Test run 3** | **Average** | Difference to baseline [%] |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Requests per second | 481,74 | 495,27 | 485,43 | **487,48** | -103,23 |
| Time per request [ms] | 207,58 | 201,91 | 206,005 | **205,17** | 52,43 |

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/KissPeter/fastapi-middlewares/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
